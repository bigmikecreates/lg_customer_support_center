## OVERVIEW

I will be exploring the below-listed frameworks from the LangChain ecosystem to design, orchestrate, and evaluate the agentic capabilities of this system:

- LangChain
- LangGraph
- LangSmith

The following document is being used to define the persona for this multi-agent system (<a href='customer_rep_persona_store\customer_support_rep_persona.md'>link to persona definiton document</a>). This also means the multi-agent system's evaluation system will be **benchmarked** against a human Customer Support Representative.
