    "3. Rate limit restrictions allow for appropriate edge-case testing.\n",
    "4. Supports core architectural choice for LangChain ecosystem (e.g. supports asynchronous backends, etc).\n",
    "5.  I can currently access the tool as a human and perform its basic functions (i.e. confirmation that it is operable as a human, and has not been deprecated/restricted discreetly)."
